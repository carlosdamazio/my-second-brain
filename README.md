This is a repo that I use to keep things that I'm studying or that I studied. It's
a collection of notes, and programs that I'd written while studying. It's a repository
of my own that I keep track of things that I did, and I use it as reference, so if you
don't actually know how to navigate through it, this is completely fine, as this organization
is something that only I understand. If you find anything that's interesting and
want to use it? That's fine as well, feel free to pick anything up, refer to the LICENSE
and the following warning.

## Warning

studying, so this is completely fine for your own usage. Please feel free to use any of the notes
